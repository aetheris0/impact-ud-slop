> [!CAUTION]
> Vector has patched Impact, Vape, and all other clients that use code replacement-based hooking that directly patches the game's script.
> There might be a way to do it that might only be available via extensions (you could hook requests to miniblox's index-{...}.js and then patch it from there so imports work and etc), but I'm not going to bother.
> If you paid attention, you'd notice that, Vape Rewrite is NOT mentioned in that list! that is because it works on latest Miniblox! See [here](https://codeberg.org/Miniblox/VapeRewrite). Vape Rewrite also has a Mace Kill and a NoFall.

   - Open `tampermonkey.user.js` from this repository
   - Copy all its contents

3. **Create a new userscript**
   - Click your userscript manager icon
   - Select "Create new script"

## Project History

**Impact For Miniblox** was a fork of the **Vape for Miniblox** project by `6x68`
(which is a continuation of the discontinued **Vape for Miniblox** project by `7GrandDadPGN`).
Before the original client was deleted ([xylex fake quit moment](https://github.com/7GrandDadPGN/7granddadpgn/commit/46a3b9e9afea226f730b9d9eaf10788b993d43ee#commitcomment-152355396)) 🥀
<!-- why am I adding all of these dates, this isn't history class LOL -->
**6x68** started updating it 13 days before that comment, and then stopped 2 days after.
But it was fully usable 3 days after that comment, and then, the first updated version of Vape, 3.0.0, was released.
